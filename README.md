#  Airplane Price Analysis & Prediction

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airplane price data and predicting prices based on various factors. Using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **machine learning techniques**, we aim to extract insights from the dataset and build a predictive model.

##  Dataset Information
The dataset contains information about different airplanes, including:
- **Model** – The name/type of the airplane.
- **Type** – Category of the airplane (e.g., Commercial, Private, Military, etc.).
- **Price** – The cost of the airplane (target variable for prediction).
- **Plane Capacity** – The number of passengers the airplane can accommodate.
- **Maintenance Cost** – The estimated cost to maintain the airplane.

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We perform various EDA techniques to understand the dataset better:
- Checking for missing values and handling them appropriately.
- Visualizing the distribution of airplane prices.
- Analyzing relationships between **price, capacity, and maintenance costs**.
- Identifying trends in airplane pricing based on different factors.

## Price Prediction
After performing EDA, we train a **machine learning model** to predict airplane prices based on available features. The model helps in estimating the cost of an airplane given its specifications.

##  Installation & Requirements
Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```
Alternatively, you can open and run the **Jupyter Notebook** (`Airplane Price dataset.ipynb`).

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```
2. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
3. Run `Airplane Price dataset.ipynb` to explore data and train the price prediction model.

##  Project Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Interactive Visualizations using **Matplotlib & Seaborn**
- Machine Learning Model for Price Prediction
- Performance Evaluation using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

##  Future Enhancements
- Improving the model with advanced algorithms.
- Adding real-time data integration for better predictions.
- Deploying the model as a web application.
